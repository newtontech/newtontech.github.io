Research Our research focus on photoelectric materials and devices Selected Publications: Click here to visit a full list of publications Advanced Materials: Buried Interfaces in Halide Perovskite Photovoltaics Understanding the fundamental properties of buried interfaces in perovskite photovoltaics is of paramount importance to the enhancement of device efficiency and stability. Studies to date have focused on the top surfaces of the polycrystalline perovskite films, yet non-radiative losses that hinder the power outputs are known to exist at the buried interfaces due to the accumulation of deep-level trap states. However, exploring these issues will become complex when the excess lead halide accumulates at the buried interface featuring non-exposed characteristics. In this work, the buried mysteries in full device stacks will be unveiled by a series of dedicated techniques including the lift-off strategy, the in-situ buried mapping spectroscopy, and the cross-sectional high-resolution microscopy. By establishing the microstructure\u2013property relations, the basic losses at the contact interfaces are systematically presented, which are induced by both the sub-microscale extended imperfections and lead-halide inhomogeneities. Furthermore, an in-depth mechanism for the most popular ammonium-halide post-treatment is explored by the exploiting time-related confocal spectroscopic imaging and materials characterizations. The surface ammonium halides could penetrate from the top surface to the bulk, especially the buried interface, and we called the molecule-assisted microstructural reconstruction. Both the bulk and interfacial losses can be considerably mitigated by the use of the passivation-molecule-assisted microstructural reconstruction, which unlocks the full potential for improving device performance. The methodology reported in this work is expected as the starting point to uncover the properties of the buried interfaces of various perovskite compositions and device structures for a broad range of applications including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and other perovskite optoelectronics. Science: Enhanced Photovoltage for Inverted Planar Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells The highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reported for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with inverted planar structures are still inferior to those of PSCs with regular structures, mainly because of lower open-circuit voltages (Voc). Here we report a strategy to reduce nonradiative recombination for the inverted devices, based on a simple solution-processed secondary growth technique. This approach produces a wider bandgap top layer and a more n-type perovskite film, which mitigates nonradiative recombination, leading to an increase in Voc by up to 100 millivolts. We achieved a high Voc of 1.21 volts without sacrificing photocurrent, corresponding to a voltage deficit of 0.41 volts at a bandgap of 1.62 electron volts. This improvement led to a stabilized power output approaching 21% at the maximum power point. Nature Reviews Materials: Minimizing Non-radiative Recombination Losses in Perovskite Solar Cells Photovoltaic solar cells based on metal-halide perovskites have gained considerable attention over the past decade because of their potentially low production cost, earth-abundant raw materials, ease of fabrication and ever-increasing power-conversion efficiencies of up to 25.2%. This type of solar cells offers the promise of generating electricity at a more competitive unit price than traditional fossil fuels by 2035. Nevertheless, the best research-cell efficiencies are still below the theoretical limit defined by the Shockley\u2013Queisser theory, owing to the presence of non-radiative recombination losses. In this Review, we analyse the predominant pathways that contribute to non-radiative recombination losses in perovskite solar cells and evaluate their impact on device performance. We then discuss how non-radiative recombination losses can be estimated through reliable characterization techniques and highlight some notable advances in mitigating these losses, which hint at pathways towards defect-free perovskite solar cells. Finally, we outline directions for future work that will push the efficiency of perovskite solar cells towards the radiative limit. Nature Communications: In Situ Dynamic Observations of Perovskite Crystallisation and Microstructure Evolution Intermediated from [PbI6]4\u2212 Cage Nanoparticles Hybrid lead halide perovskites have emerged as high-performance photovoltaic materials with their extraordinary optoelectronic properties. In particular, the remarkable device efficiency is strongly influenced by the perovskite crystallinity and the film morphology. Here, we investigate the perovskites crystallisation kinetics and growth mechanism in real time from liquid precursor continually to the final uniform film. We utilize some advanced in situ characterisation techniques including synchrotron-based grazing incident X-ray diffraction to observe crystal structure and chemical transition of perovskites. The nano-assemble model from perovskite intermediated [PbI6]4\u2212 cage nanoparticles to bulk polycrystals is proposed to understand perovskites formation at a molecular- or nano-level. A crystallisation-depletion mechanism is developed to elucidate the periodic crystallisation and the kinetically trapped morphology at a mesoscopic level. Based on these in situ dynamics studies, the whole process of the perovskites formation and transformation from the molecular to the microstructure over relevant temperature and time scales is successfully demonstrated. Nature Communications: Dielectric Screening in Perovskite Photovoltaics The performance of perovskite photovoltaics is fundamentally impeded by the presence of undesirable defects that contribute to non-radiative losses within the devices. Although mitigating these losses has been extensively reported by numerous passivation strategies, a detailed understanding of loss origins within the devices remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the defect capturing probability estimated by the capture cross-section is decreased by varying the dielectric response, producing the dielectric screening effect in the perovskite. The resulting perovskites also show reduced surface recombination and a weaker electron-phonon coupling. All of these boost the power conversion efficiency to 22.3% for an inverted perovskite photovoltaic device with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.25\u2009V and a low voltage deficit of 0.37\u2009V (a bandgap ~1.62\u2009eV). Our results provide not only an in-depth understanding of the carrier capture processes in perovskites, but also a promising pathway for realizing highly efficient devices via dielectric regulation.
